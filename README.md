### Relevant Experience & Projects

#### 🧠 InovaCamp Qi Tech
My team and I developed a P2P credit solution for SaaS, packaging a full-stack solution for digital wallet tracking and a **Machine Learning** *engine* for real-time *risk scoring*.

Our solution achieved 6th place among dozens of teams, enhancing my skills in *fast problem-solving*, entrepreneurship, project management, and team collaboration.

#### 💼 Poli Júnior (Junior Enterprise of Poli USP)
After a series of internal training sessions, I mastered the best practices of Web Scraping and Data Science. Combined with my curiosity and previous knowledge, this position allowed me to apply theoretical software and ML learning to real problems, learning to differentiate the good from the practical.

I was a Project Analyst on the largest project ever sold by the company, being responsible, along with a colleague, for the development of an **automated Data Lake** and an **internal Chatbot** for a large engineering company.
